## Interfaces

### AttributesMapInterface

Defined in:
[src/types/interfaces/attributes.ts:9](https://github.com/phun-ky/speccer/blob/main/src/types/interfaces/attributes.ts#L9)

Interface representing a map of attributes with string keys and string values.

This interface defines a structure for a map of attributes, where the keys are
strings (attribute names) and the values are also strings (attribute values). It
can be used to define the structure of objects that store attributes in
key-value pairs.

```
