# What is SPECCER?

**SPECCER** is a zero dependency JavaScript package to highlight elements on web
pages and in documentation. It's easy to use and highly customizable, making it
the perfect tool for developers, designers, and content creators alike.

**SPECCER** was originally created to make it easier to document components in a
design system, but you can use it for whatever you like, whenever you need to
highlight any element in your web projects.

With **SPECCER**, you can highlight any element on a web page or in
documentation with pins, markers, arrows, and more. This can be useful for a
variety of purposes, such as:

- Showcasing the different parts of a component or design system
- Documenting how to use a particular element or feature
- Drawing attention to important information
- Creating interactive tutorials or demos

**SPECCER** is incredibly easy to use. Simply add the `data-speccer` (or other
tags for other features) attribute to any element you want to highlight, and
**SPECCER** will do the rest. You can also customize the look and feel of
**SPECCER** to match your own branding or style guide.
